This site has just undergone a move from its old domain [awens.org](http://awens.org) to its current domain. All other services are also being migrated to the new domain.

## New Logo

In addition to the new domain, I've got a new logo from [logojoy](https://logojoy.com). Here it is in all its glory:

![new logo](/resources/awen.io-logo/svg/color_logo_transparent.svg)

It uses the rune for the druidic awen, and is purple in colour. Logojoy also provides a [brand guide](https://logojoy.com/b/awen), but I will probably flagrantly ignore it...
